	<h1>Cookies</h1>
	<p>To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files
		called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.</p>

	<h2>What are cookies?</h2>
	<p>A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer
		or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to
		remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font
		size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you
		don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site
		or browse from one page to another.</p>

	<h2>How do we use cookies?</h2>
	<p>
		This website uses Google Analytics, a statistics service that uses
		cookies anonymously.<br /> Cookies are also created to store your
		session information if you check the "remember me" box when you log
		in.<br /> Enabling these cookies is not strictly necessary for the
		website to work but it will provide you with a better browsing
		experience. You can delete or block these cookies, but if you do that
		some features of this site may not work as intended. The
		cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally and
		the pattern data is fully under our control. These cookies are not
		used for any purpose other than those described here.
	</p>

	<h2>How to control cookies?</h2>
	<p>
		You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see <a
			target="_blank" href="http://aboutcookies.org">aboutcookies.org</a>.
		You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you
		can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do
		this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every
		time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not
		work.
